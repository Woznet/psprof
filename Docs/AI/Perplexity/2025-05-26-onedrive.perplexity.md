# what is the optimal approach for dealing with OneDrive annoyances and my PowerShell (core) \$PROFILE

OneDrive can present several frustrating issues, but most can be resolved with systematic troubleshooting approaches. Similarly, PowerShell profiles can be optimized to reduce startup delays and improve your overall experience.

## **OneDrive Common Issues and Solutions**

**Sync Problems**
The most frequent OneDrive issues involve synchronization failures. When files aren't syncing properly, start by checking if OneDrive is actually running - look for the OneDrive icon in your system tray[^1_8]. If it appears grayed out, you may need to sign in again[^1_8]. Sometimes OneDrive syncing gets paused automatically due to battery saver mode or metered connections, which you can disable in Settings > Sync and backup[^1_8].

For persistent sync issues, try pausing OneDrive syncing temporarily, moving problematic files to a local folder, then resuming sync[^1_4]. If you encounter file conflicts (indicated by a yellow triangle on the OneDrive icon), right-click and select "Resolve" to choose which version to keep[^1_4].

**Storage and Performance Issues**
OneDrive storage limits can cause performance problems, especially with large files or duplicates[^1_1]. Consider using selective sync to only download necessary folders to your local machine[^1_8]. You can also enable "Files On-Demand" in OneDrive settings, which keeps files in the cloud and downloads them only when needed[^1_8].

**Reset and Reinstall Options**
When other solutions fail, resetting OneDrive often resolves persistent issues. Press Windows + R and run one of these commands[^1_3][^1_4]:

- `%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset`

This reset won't delete your files but will disconnect all sync connections and rebuild the configuration[^1_3].

## **PowerShell Profile Optimization**

**Understanding Profile Types**
PowerShell has multiple profile types stored in the `$PROFILE` variable[^1_6]. The default `$PROFILE` points to "Current User, Current Host" but you can access others like `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` for settings that apply across all PowerShell hosts[^1_6][^1_7].

**Performance Optimization Strategy**
Complex profiles can significantly delay PowerShell startup. One effective approach is implementing lazy loading by moving interactive-only customizations into a separate function that only runs when needed[^1_9]. Create an `Initialize-Profile` function containing PSReadLine customizations, path modifications, and PSDrives, then call it from your prompt function only during interactive sessions[^1_9].

**Profile Structure Best Practices**
Organize your profile logically:

- Put common items used across all hosts in `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts`[^1_6]
- Store host-specific items in `$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost`[^1_6]
- Use conditional loading for modules and features you don't always need[^1_6]

**Creating and Editing Profiles**
If your profile doesn't exist, create it with[^1_6]:

```powershell
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
    New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
}
```

Edit your profile using your preferred editor:

```powershell
code $PROFILE  # VS Code
notepad $PROFILE  # Notepad
```

**Measuring and Improving Performance**
Use tools like PSProfiler to identify performance bottlenecks in your profile[^1_9]. Focus optimization efforts on the slowest-executing lines first. Consider deferring initialization of tools and customizations until they're actually needed rather than loading everything at startup[^1_9].

## **Integration Considerations**

When using both OneDrive and PowerShell profiles, be mindful that storing your PowerShell profile in a OneDrive-synced location can cause sync conflicts if you use multiple machines. Consider keeping machine-specific profiles local while syncing shared functions and modules through OneDrive in a separate folder that you can dot-source from your main profile.

The key to managing both OneDrive annoyances and PowerShell profile optimization is taking a systematic approach: identify specific issues, apply targeted solutions, and implement performance optimizations that maintain functionality while improving user experience.

# I’m more concerned with the fact that OneDrive alters the user’s registered folder paths, particularly the “My Documents” / \$HOME/Documents folder which in turn alters the primary PowerShell configuration and profile directories and also the installed modules folder(s) and places them in OneDrive

OneDrive's automatic folder redirection fundamentally changes Windows' default folder structure by modifying the registry entries that define where system folders like Documents are located. This creates significant issues for PowerShell users because it forces configuration files, profiles, and modules into cloud storage without explicit consent.

## **How OneDrive Hijacks Folder Paths**

When OneDrive is configured with folder backup enabled, it modifies the Windows registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` to redirect the "Personal" folder (Documents) from `C:\Users\username\Documents` to `C:\Users\username\OneDrive\Documents`[^2_1][^2_4]. This registry change affects all applications that rely on the standard Documents folder location, including PowerShell.

PowerShell determines profile and module locations based on the `Documents` folder path stored in this registry key[^2_10][^2_12]. When OneDrive redirects this path, your PowerShell profile automatically moves from the local `$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\` directory to `$HOME\OneDrive\Documents\PowerShell\`, and the user-specific module installation path in `$env:PSModulePath` similarly gets redirected to OneDrive[^2_4][^2_5].

## **Impact on PowerShell Configuration**

**Profile Location Changes**
Your PowerShell `$PROFILE` variable will point to the OneDrive location instead of the local Documents folder[^2_4]. This means your profile scripts are automatically synced to the cloud, which can cause issues when working offline or when different machines have different PowerShell modules installed[^2_8].

**Module Installation Redirection**
The user-specific module installation path (`CurrentUser` scope) gets redirected to OneDrive, causing all modules installed with `Install-Module -Scope CurrentUser` to be stored in the cloud[^2_5]. This creates unnecessary cloud storage usage and potential sync conflicts when modules contain machine-specific configurations.

**Help Files and Other Data**
Commands like `Update-Help` also save help files to the redirected OneDrive location rather than keeping them local[^2_5].

## **Solutions to Reclaim Local Control**

**Method 1: Disable OneDrive Folder Backup**
The cleanest approach is to disable OneDrive's folder backup feature entirely. Open OneDrive settings, navigate to **Backup** > **Manage Backup**, and turn off backup for Documents, Desktop, and Pictures[^2_1][^2_6]. This stops OneDrive from redirecting these folders while preserving your existing file structure.

**Method 2: Registry Modification**
For more direct control, you can manually edit the registry to restore the original Documents path. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` and change the "Personal" key value from the OneDrive path back to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`[^2_12]. This immediately restores the local Documents folder as the default location.

**Method 3: Hybrid Approach with Profile Linking**
If you want to keep some OneDrive functionality while maintaining local PowerShell configurations, create your profile in the local Documents folder and use dot-sourcing to include shared components from OneDrive[^2_4][^2_8]. Add this to your local profile:

```powershell
$sharedProfile = "$env:UserProfile\OneDrive\Documents\PowerShell\SharedProfile.ps1"
if (Test-Path $sharedProfile) {
    . $sharedProfile
}
```


## **Preventing Future Issues**

**Group Policy Controls**
For enterprise environments, administrators can use Group Policy to prevent OneDrive from redirecting known folders by enabling the "Prevent users from moving their Windows known folders to OneDrive" policy[^2_9]. This sets the registry value `[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive]"KFMBlockOptIn"=dword:00000001`.

**PowerShell Module Path Management**
After restoring local folder paths, verify that `$env:PSModulePath` no longer contains OneDrive paths. If it does, you can modify it in your profile to prioritize local module locations.

**Best Practices for Profile Management**
Microsoft explicitly recommends against storing PowerShell profiles in OneDrive-synced locations due to potential module loading failures and script errors when connectivity is limited[^2_10]. Keep machine-specific configurations local while using OneDrive only for truly portable scripts and functions.

The core issue is that OneDrive's "helpful" folder redirection fundamentally changes how Windows applications locate user data without providing clear opt-out mechanisms during initial setup. By understanding these registry modifications and implementing the appropriate solution for your environment, you can regain control over where your PowerShell configurations and modules are stored.

# What is the best practice? Should I still sync / backup my documents to OneDrive but implement something like .onedriveignore for certain folders? Does OneDrive impact the startup time of my profile?

The best practice for managing OneDrive's impact on PowerShell configurations involves a nuanced approach that balances convenience with performance and reliability.

## **OneDrive's Performance Impact on PowerShell**

OneDrive significantly affects PowerShell startup times when your profile and modules are stored in synced locations. When PowerShell loads, it scans the `$env:PSModulePath` directories to discover available modules, and if these paths point to OneDrive locations, the scanning process must wait for OneDrive to ensure all files are locally available[^3_7][^3_8]. This can cause startup delays ranging from several seconds to over a minute, especially with large module collections like the Azure PowerShell modules.

The performance degradation occurs because OneDrive uses "Files On-Demand" by default, meaning files exist as cloud placeholders until accessed. When PowerShell attempts to enumerate modules during startup, it triggers OneDrive to download metadata and potentially full files, creating substantial delays[^3_8].

## **Current State of OneDrive Ignore Functionality**

Unfortunately, OneDrive does **not** currently support `.onedriveignore` files or similar selective exclusion mechanisms for subfolders within synced directories[^3_3]. While users have repeatedly requested this functionality since 2023, Microsoft has not implemented it. OneDrive only allows you to exclude entire root folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures) through the "Manage Backup" feature, but you cannot selectively exclude specific subfolders like `Documents\PowerShell` or `Documents\PowerShell\Modules`[^3_2][^3_4].

## **Recommended Best Practices**

**Option 1: Hybrid Approach with Registry Modification**
The most effective solution is to restore the Documents folder to its local location by modifying the Windows registry. Change the "Personal" folder path in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` from the OneDrive location back to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`[^3_6]. This immediately moves your PowerShell profiles and modules back to local storage while allowing you to selectively sync other document folders.

**Option 2: Profile Redirection with Dot-Sourcing**
Create your main PowerShell profile locally and use dot-sourcing to include shared components from OneDrive. Place machine-specific configurations in the local profile and portable functions in OneDrive[^3_5][^3_6]:

```powershell
# In your local profile
$sharedProfile = "$env:UserProfile\OneDrive\Documents\PowerShell\SharedFunctions.ps1"
if (Test-Path $sharedProfile) {
    . $sharedProfile
}
```

**Option 3: Disable Documents Backup Entirely**
Turn off OneDrive's Documents folder backup through OneDrive Settings > Backup > Manage Backup > Stop Backup for Documents[^3_4]. This prevents the folder redirection while preserving OneDrive functionality for other content.

## **Module Path Management**

After implementing any of these solutions, verify that your `$env:PSModulePath` no longer contains OneDrive paths. Some users have created profile scripts that automatically remove OneDrive paths from the module search path to improve performance[^3_8]:

```powershell
# Remove OneDrive paths from PSModulePath
$env:PSModulePath = ($env:PSModulePath -split ';' | Where-Object { $_ -notlike "*OneDrive*" }) -join ';'
```


## **Alternative Workarounds**

**Directory Junctions for Selective Sync**
If you must keep Documents in OneDrive, you can use directory junctions (symlinks) to selectively sync only specific folders while keeping PowerShell configurations local[^3_1]. Create junctions from your local Documents folder to OneDrive for only the folders you want synced:

```cmd
mklink /j "C:\Users\username\OneDrive\Documents\ImportantFolder" "C:\Users\username\Documents\ImportantFolder"
```

**Third-Party Sync Solutions**
Consider using alternative sync tools like CBackup that offer more granular control over file exclusions, including the ability to exclude specific file types and subfolders[^3_2].

## **Microsoft's Official Recommendation**

Microsoft explicitly recommends against storing PowerShell profiles in OneDrive-synced locations due to potential module loading failures and connectivity issues[^3_6][^3_9]. The official documentation suggests keeping machine-specific configurations local while using cloud storage only for truly portable scripts and shared functions.

The consensus among PowerShell experts is clear: **the best location for PowerShell profiles is anywhere that OneDrive does not sync**[^3_9]. While OneDrive backup for general documents can be valuable, PowerShell configurations should remain local to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

# https://github.com/WCY-dt/OneDriveIgnore

The OneDriveIgnore project provides a third-party solution that implements `.onedriveignore` functionality similar to `.gitignore`, addressing the limitation that Microsoft's OneDrive doesn't natively support selective file exclusion within synced folders[^4_1][^4_2].

## **How OneDriveIgnore Works**

This tool leverages OneDrive's ability to desynchronize specific files through registry modifications. It operates by setting the registry key `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\OneDrive\EnableODIgnoreListFromGPO` to control which files OneDrive should exclude from synchronization[^4_1][^4_2].

## **Implementation and Usage**

**Setup Process**
To use OneDriveIgnore, you create a `.onedriveignore` file in the root directory of your local OneDrive storage path. The file syntax mirrors `.gitignore`, supporting regular expressions for pattern matching[^4_1][^4_2].

**Example Configuration**

```
example0.exe
example1.*
*example2
PowerShell/
Documents/PowerShell/Modules/
```

**Important Limitations**
The tool requires re-execution of the script each time you modify the `.onedriveignore` file, making it less seamless than native Git ignore functionality[^4_1][^4_2].

## **Application to Your PowerShell Profile Problem**

For your specific use case of preventing PowerShell configurations from syncing to OneDrive, you could add patterns like:

- `PowerShell/` - to exclude the entire PowerShell configuration directory
- `Documents/PowerShell/Modules/` - to specifically exclude module installations
- `*.ps1xml` - to exclude PowerShell formatting files
- `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` - to exclude specific profile files


## **Considerations and Alternatives**

**Registry-Based Approach**
Since OneDriveIgnore modifies system-level registry keys under `HKLM`, it requires administrative privileges and affects OneDrive behavior system-wide rather than per-user[^4_1][^4_2].

**Comparison to Native Solutions**
While this tool provides the `.onedriveignore` functionality that Microsoft hasn't implemented, the previously discussed approaches of disabling Documents folder backup or using registry modifications to restore local folder paths remain more reliable for PowerShell configurations.

**Maintenance Requirements**
The need to re-run the script after each `.onedriveignore` modification makes this solution less convenient than native OneDrive features would be, and introduces potential for configuration drift if the script isn't consistently executed.

For your PowerShell profile management needs, OneDriveIgnore offers a viable workaround, but the more direct approaches of either disabling OneDrive's Documents folder backup entirely or restoring local folder paths through registry modification would provide better long-term stability and performance for PowerShell operations.

# I also leverage windows dev drive. Should I change the primary module path to use the dev drive? What about something like %LOCALAPPDATA% also?

Using a Dev Drive for your PowerShell modules presents compelling advantages, especially given your OneDrive concerns, but requires careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.

## **Dev Drive Benefits for PowerShell Modules**

Dev Drive offers significant performance improvements for PowerShell module operations due to its optimized file system (ReFS) and reduced Microsoft Defender scanning overhead[^5_4]. Since PowerShell scans all directories in `$env:PSModulePath` during startup to discover available modules, placing your modules on a Dev Drive can substantially reduce this scanning time, particularly with large module collections like Azure PowerShell.

The performance gains are especially pronounced during module installation, updates, and initial discovery since Dev Drive uses asynchronous scanning rather than real-time scanning for Microsoft Defender[^5_4]. This eliminates the file access delays that can occur when OneDrive tries to download Files On-Demand during module enumeration.

## **Implementation Strategy for Dev Drive**

**Creating a Custom Module Path**
You can add a Dev Drive location to your `$env:PSModulePath` by modifying your PowerShell profile. The most effective approach is to prepend your Dev Drive path so PowerShell searches it first:

```powershell
# Add to your PowerShell profile
$devDriveModulePath = "D:\PowerShell\Modules"  # Adjust drive letter as needed
if (Test-Path $devDriveModulePath) {
    $env:PSModulePath = "$devDriveModulePath;$env:PSModulePath"
}
```

**Installing Modules to Dev Drive**
Since `Install-Module` doesn't support custom installation paths directly[^5_5], you'll need to use the `-Scope AllUsers` parameter with elevated permissions, or manually manage module installations. For custom installations, you can download modules and extract them to your Dev Drive location, then they'll be automatically discovered through the modified `$env:PSModulePath`.

## **LocalAppData Alternative Considerations**

Using `%LOCALAPPDATA%` for PowerShell modules offers a middle-ground approach that keeps modules local while avoiding OneDrive sync issues. You can access this path using `[Environment]::GetFolderPath('LocalApplicationData')`[^5_2].

**Advantages of LocalAppData:**

- Guaranteed to be local (never synced by OneDrive)
- User-specific without requiring administrator privileges
- Standard Windows location that applications expect to use

**Implementation Example:**

```powershell
$localModulePath = Join-Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath('LocalApplicationData')) "PowerShell\Modules"
if (-not (Test-Path $localModulePath)) {
    New-Item -Path $localModulePath -ItemType Directory -Force
}
$env:PSModulePath = "$localModulePath;$env:PSModulePath"
```


## **Recommended Approach**

**Primary Recommendation: Dev Drive**
Given that you already leverage Dev Drive, creating a PowerShell modules directory there is the optimal solution. The performance benefits align perfectly with PowerShell's module discovery process, and it completely eliminates OneDrive interference.

**Hybrid Strategy**
Consider implementing a tiered approach:

1. **Dev Drive**: For frequently used modules and development-related modules
2. **LocalAppData**: For system utilities and less frequently accessed modules
3. **Keep AllUsers scope**: For modules that need to be available system-wide

**Profile Configuration**
Add this to your PowerShell profile to implement the hybrid approach:

```powershell
# Dev Drive for primary modules (highest priority)
$devDriveModules = "D:\PowerShell\Modules"
$localAppDataModules = Join-Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath('LocalApplicationData')) "PowerShell\Modules"

$customPaths = @($devDriveModules, $localAppDataModules) | Where-Object { Test-Path $_ }
if ($customPaths) {
    $env:PSModulePath = ($customPaths + ($env:PSModulePath -split ';')) -join ';'
}
```


## **Security and Administrative Considerations**

When using Dev Drive for PowerShell modules, verify that Microsoft Defender's Performance Mode meets your security requirements[^5_4]. The reduced scanning may not be appropriate for all organizational security policies. Additionally, ensure proper Access Control Lists (ACLs) are configured if multiple users access the same system.

The Dev Drive approach provides the best performance while completely avoiding OneDrive complications, making it the superior choice for your PowerShell module management strategy.

# Assume PSResourceGet for managing installations

Using PSResourceGet for module management significantly improves your Dev Drive and custom module path strategy, as it provides more granular control over installation locations and better performance than the legacy PowerShellGet v2.

## **PSResourceGet Installation Path Control**

PSResourceGet's `Install-PSResource` cmdlet supports the `-Scope` parameter which determines where modules are installed. When you specify `-Scope CurrentUser`, it installs to the user-specific module path, while `-Scope AllUsers` requires elevation and installs to the system-wide location[^6_2]. However, PSResourceGet doesn't directly support custom installation paths like your Dev Drive location.

**Workaround for Custom Paths**
To install modules directly to your Dev Drive, you can use the `Save-PSResource` cmdlet to download modules to a specific location, then manually place them in your Dev Drive module directory:

```powershell
# Save module to Dev Drive location
$devDriveModules = "D:\PowerShell\Modules"
Save-PSResource -Name Az -Path $devDriveModules -Repository PSGallery
```


## **Performance Benefits with PSResourceGet**

PSResourceGet offers substantial performance improvements over PowerShellGet v2, with installation times being significantly faster[^6_3]. For the Microsoft Graph module (39 modules), PSResourceGet completes installation in 58 seconds compared to PowerShellGet v2's 3 minutes and 14 seconds[^6_3]. This performance advantage becomes even more pronounced when combined with Dev Drive's optimized file system.

## **Module Path Management Strategy**

**Profile Configuration for PSResourceGet**
Configure your PowerShell profile to prioritize your Dev Drive module path while maintaining compatibility with PSResourceGet:

```powershell
# Dev Drive module path (highest priority)
$devDriveModules = "D:\PowerShell\Modules"
$localAppDataModules = Join-Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath('LocalApplicationData')) "PowerShell\Modules"

# Ensure directories exist
@($devDriveModules, $localAppDataModules) | ForEach-Object {
    if (-not (Test-Path $_)) {
        New-Item -Path $_ -ItemType Directory -Force
    }
}

# Modify PSModulePath to prioritize custom locations
$customPaths = @($devDriveModules, $localAppDataModules)
$currentPaths = $env:PSModulePath -split ';'
$env:PSModulePath = ($customPaths + $currentPaths) -join ';'
```


## **Repository Configuration**

**Trust PowerShell Gallery**
Since you'll be using PSResourceGet frequently, configure the PowerShell Gallery as trusted to avoid repeated prompts:

```powershell
Set-PSResourceRepository -Name PSGallery -Trusted
```

**Installation Workflow**
For modules you want on your Dev Drive, use this workflow:

```powershell
# Install to default location first
Install-PSResource -Name ModuleName -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery

# Then move to Dev Drive if needed
$moduleName = "ModuleName"
$sourceLocation = Get-InstalledPSResource -Name $moduleName | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty InstalledLocation
$targetLocation = Join-Path $devDriveModules $moduleName
Move-Item -Path $sourceLocation -Destination $targetLocation
```


## **Version Management**

PSResourceGet provides enhanced version management capabilities. You can install specific version ranges using bracket notation:

```powershell
# Install latest version within range
Install-PSResource Az -Version '[7.3.0, 8.3.0]'

# Install exact version
Install-PSResource Az -Version 2.14.0
```


## **Cleanup and Maintenance**

**Removing Old Versions**
PSResourceGet's `Uninstall-PSResource` is significantly faster than the legacy `Uninstall-Module`, completing in 396 milliseconds versus 3 minutes and 48 seconds[^6_3]. This makes cleanup operations much more efficient:

```powershell
# Remove specific version
Uninstall-PSResource -Name ModuleName -Version 1.0.0

# Reinstall latest version (overwrites existing)
Install-PSResource -Name ModuleName -Reinstall
```


## **Integration with Your OneDrive Strategy**

Since PSResourceGet respects the standard `$env:PSModulePath`, your Dev Drive configuration automatically takes precedence over any OneDrive-synced locations. This ensures that:

- Module discovery prioritizes your Dev Drive location
- Installation performance benefits from Dev Drive's optimized file system
- OneDrive sync conflicts are completely avoided for PowerShell modules

The combination of PSResourceGet's improved performance and Dev Drive's optimized storage creates an ideal environment for PowerShell module management while completely bypassing OneDrive-related complications.
